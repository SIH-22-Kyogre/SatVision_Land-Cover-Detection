- The dataset has ~1000 RGB images collected by DigitalGlobe's satellite.
- The images have a 50cm pixel resolution.
- The images are of size 2448x2448.

## Advantages
- All files have are of .jpg/.jpeg type.
- All files have corresponding labels(mask).
- The data is automatically split into training, validation and testing folders.
          
          - Training: 803 images
          - Validation: 171 images
          - Testing: 172 images
          
## Disadvantanges
- The dataset consists of only RGB images.
- The number of images may not be suffficient for some deep learning models.
