Three Deep Learning Models were used for classifying the land cover:
1. ResNet50
2. ResNet152v2
3. VGG16

ResNet50:
Has an accuracy of 94.7% on unseen data.
~95% accuracy on residential and industrial areas 
Can differentiate residential and non-residential areas well.
Cannot differentiate forest area and water bodies as precisely as other classes.

ResNet152v2:
Has an accuracy of 96% on unseen data.
~97% accuracy on industrial areas 
~92% accuracy on residential areas 
Can differentiate residential and non-residential areas well.
Better than ResNet50 at differentiatiating forest areas and water bodies.
